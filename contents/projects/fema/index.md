intro: As an intern at FEMA I created numerous different maps for emergency management purposes, including a 30ft map for use in disaster exercises.  Other maps include federal staging areas, emergency evacuation routes and disaster impacts.  I was required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement so I cannot share the maps I created during my tenure with the agency.
