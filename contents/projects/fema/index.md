I've made crossword puzzles for the [New York
Times](http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/jonah-kagan/), the [Brown
Daily Herald](http://acrosstobear.wordpress.com/). Some of my puzzles
were recently published in
[Word.](http://www.amazon.com/Word-Crossword-Puzzles-Prove-Square/dp/0761167552),
a book of crosswords by young constructors created by Natan Last.
