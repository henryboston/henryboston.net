intro: As an intern at FEMA I created numerous different maps for emergency management situations including a 30ft map to be used for disaster exercises.  Other maps include federal staging areas, emergency evacuation plans and disaster impacts.  Unfortunately I was required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement so I cannot share the maps I created there.
