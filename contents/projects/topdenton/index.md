Once the USB drive was complete I simply inserted it into the computer and rebooted.  I changed the boot order so the computer booted from the USB drive first.  Then I simply went through the installer.  I made sure to download the Basic Ubuntu Server, OpenSSH server, DNS server, and LAMP server software collections.
