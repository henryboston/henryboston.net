While attending the University of North Texas as a student I have worked three different student assistant positions for two different departments. I have held three unique titles with unique responsibilities: web developer, web designer and system administrator.

The majority of my work has been with the Drupal Content Management system. I have consistently designed and developed numerous sites for the Division of Student Affairs and AITS Web Support using Drupal. I have provided technical support for over five hundred Drupal websites in the University of North Texas system while working as a system administrator for the Central Web support team. I also managed over ten different departments web presence while conducting training in web content management for staff members.
